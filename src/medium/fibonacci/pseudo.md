# Pseudo Code Solution
create function which takes num as an argument
    fibonacciArray = [1, 1]
    for loop, let i = 1, and itterate until i = num.
        let variable 1 = 1
        let variable 2 = 1
        let result = 0
        result = variable 1 + variable 2
        variable 2 = result
        variable 1 = variable 2
        push result into fibonacci array.
