# Plain English Solution
Firstly make a function to determine all the numbers which divide evenly into the given number. Create a sum of all those numbers. This is the Sum of Proper Divisors.
Do this for all numbers between 1-100,000 and place them in an object as key value pairs. Loop through the object of the Sum of Proper Divisors to see if any follow the following argument: d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b. Where `d` is the object Sum of Proper Divisors, and `a` and `b` are the entries, comparing the keys and values.
